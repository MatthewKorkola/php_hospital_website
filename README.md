This project was created as part of a databases course at Western University.
It is a simple website which mimics a hospital database.
The user can, for instance, see the doctors currently registered at certain hospitals.
The user can see relevant doctor or hospital information.
The user can also add or delete doctors, or see which doctors treat which patients.
